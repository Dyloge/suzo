This python code advances slides based on presenter's speech. It doesn't work on special voice commands but works based on the similarity between presenter's speech and pre-written reference text for each slide.
SpeechRecognition module is used for converting speech to text and document similarity of gensim module -cosine similarity of tf-idf bag of words algorithm- is used for document similarity.Implementation of better speech recognition and document similarity algoriyhms would result in improvment.
